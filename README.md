I&nbsp;am a&nbsp;software engineer with strong front-end expertise in modern web technologies, particularly <strong>React</strong> and <strong>TypeScript</strong>, complemented by experience in <strong>Python</strong>, <strong>Rust</strong>, Node.js, machine learning, databases, and DevOps. I&nbsp;hold both a&nbsp;BSc and an&nbsp;MSc degree in <strong>Applied Computer Science</strong> with a&nbsp;specialization in Software Engineering from <strong>Wrocław University of Science and Technology</strong>, where I&nbsp;graduated with top honors and was actively involved in scientific research. During my internship at <strong>Atlassian</strong>, I&nbsp;contributed to Jira's Forge platform by shipping production features, fixing bugs, and improving internal monitoring. My experience spans the design and development of a&nbsp;wide range of personal, academic, and real-world software systems.
