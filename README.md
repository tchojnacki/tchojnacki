I'm a&nbsp;mid full-stack software engineer with a&nbsp;focus on front-end development in <strong>React and TypeScript</strong>, backed by back-end experience in Node.js, Python, Rust, databases, DevOps, and AI. I&nbsp;hold both a&nbsp;bachelor's and a&nbsp;<strong>master's degree in applied computer science</strong> from Wrocław University of Science and Technology, where I&nbsp;graduated top of my class and conducted scientific research. During my internship at <strong>Atlassian</strong>, I&nbsp;shipped production features to Jira, helping improve an app used by 300&#8239;000 teams worldwide. As a&nbsp;<strong>freelance developer</strong>, I&nbsp;collaborated directly with clients to design, build, and deploy websites that attract over 1&#8239;000 monthly users.
